# Welcome to the robot

## starting the repo

Once you've cloned this repo, run the [install script](https://github.com/SmartFarmingPerenMinor/SFP-TreeCutter/master/install.sh)(if you haven't already).
```bash
./install.sh
```
This sets up the environment for both the simulation and real robot.

To start working with the robot, check out our Documentations.

Currently we can:
- Simulate the UR10e
- Simulate the IntelRealsense D435
- Simulate movement
- Simulate an octomap

- Connect to the real UR10e
- Move the real UR10e 
- Visualize an octomap from the real environment
