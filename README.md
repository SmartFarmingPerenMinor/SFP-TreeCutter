# Welcome to the robot

## starting the repo

Once you've cloned this repo, run the [install script](https://github.com/SmartFarmingPerenMinor/SFP-TreeCutter/master/install.sh)(if you haven't already).
This sets up the environment for both the simulation and real robot.
This instantiates the connection between the bot and the computer over ethernet (start program on the controller)
```bash
./start_connection.sh
```
