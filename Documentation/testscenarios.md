# Test scenario's

## Introduction
To completely check the viability of the octomapping software we have to check the capabilities (think of max resolution) to the performance on the computer in the lab.

To test the performance of the computer we will test on both the central processing unit and the graphical processing unit of the computer.

Both of these test will use the following resolutions of the octomapping software to see the performance and update speed.
- 5cm
- 4cm
- 3cm
- 2cm
- 1cm
- 5mm

The attempted frame rate (/max setting in RVIZ) is 30. Meaning the computer won't have render higher than this.

The scenario's will be tested and results will be appended in this document aswell.
## GPU Test's
**Prerequisits**
For all these test's the computer will run the program on the graphical processing unit.
